# Pizza Ordering System

This project is a simple **Pizza Ordering System** implemented in TypeScript. It allows users to manage a pizza menu, place orders, and complete them while maintaining a cash register balance and an order queue.

## Features
- **Menu Management**: Add new pizzas to the menu with a name and price.
- **Place Orders**: Select a pizza from the menu to place an order.
- **Order Completion**: Mark orders as completed.
- **Cash Register Tracking**: Automatically update the cash register when an order is placed.
- **Error Handling**: Ensures invalid pizzas or orders are handled gracefully.

```

## Known Issues
- Duplicate pizza names are allowed in the menu; consider adding unique name validation.

## Future Improvements
- Add a unique identifier for each pizza.
- Support for removing pizzas from the menu.
- Enhance order management with timestamps and customer details.
